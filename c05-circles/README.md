### Description
Simple CSS loader, live at https://codepen.io/merkund/pen/exGYJb

### Process
At first I wanted to make a pattern, later on while doing my research I've decided to work more on my CSS animations. I've never done a loading animation before, so I took this opportunity to make one. Not that much exciting but it was fun.

### Time span
**15 mins** - it went quick thanks to [w3schools snippets](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp)
