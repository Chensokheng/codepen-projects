### Description
CSS styled login form, with a purple twist. Live at [CodePen.](https://codepen.io/merkund/pen/jdBjYO)

### Process
After finishing HTML section in Zero to Mastery course on Udemy, I've wanted to practice more on how to make an HTML form (since I didn't have good knowledge before, when I made my first one). Also, I've added a 'hard' shadow instead of a typical box-shadow, again for practice. 

### Time span
**2 hours** - spent too much time on choosing appropriate emojis
